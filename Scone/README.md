This code was taken modified from the SCONE tutorial (https://scone.software/doku.php?id=tutorials:start) for patholigical gait. To run on your own you will need to install the SCONE software and download a copy of the repository. You can then open any one of the .scone files and optimize the model. Note this will take some time to optimize.
